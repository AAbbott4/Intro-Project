		<h2>It's me...</h2>
		<h1>Adam Abbott</h1>

		<h3>Who am I?</h3>
		<p>I am 39 years old, and I feel like I am still not on the correct career path.  I spent my earlier years enamoured with computers.  In high school, my classmates and I used Ti83+ graphing calculators for our courses, but we would write code for small programs for use on our calculators, like simple unit conversions for physics, or one simplifying the Pythagorean theorem for math.  Also while I was at MUN, the one course that, to this day, I remember the most was AMAT 2120 Introduction to Mathematical Programming.  It was a math course, but the course was based around writing code in C++ to solve math problems.  But through one decision or another, I decided that a career in IT was not for me and I should pursue a career in something else, because I felt my enjoyment of computers would diminish if I spent all my time with them as my full time career, and that, keeping it a hobby would still allow myself to get excited about the field.</p>
		<p>After years of uncertainty about a career path, I found a program at CNA, which was Welding Engineering Technician, that lead to my current work life.  I am a Quality Control inspector in the Oil & Gas Industry.  But the lifestyle and constant travelling for work is not what I wanted when I started down this path, and I still have that voice in the back of my head telling me that, all those years ago I should not have strayed away from my interest in computers.</p>
		<p>The field has grown so much since I graduated high school, 21 years ago, and my interest in the field has not diminished.  I am in awe of the work that programmers and software engineers do, and I know I should have chosen that path when I had the opportunity back then.</p>
		<p>Although I would not go back in time to change things, because the life I have lead 	this far has taught me so much and given me my beautiful wife and 2 amazing kids.  I do wish career wise, I was given more information at the time to make a better informed decision.  But it is never too late to change those things now.  I would like nothing more than to have a career in the software industry, working on programs for smart devices, or for a company on the rise in the growing tech sector of Newfoundland.</p>

		<h3>Why Get Coding?</h3>
		<p>I came across an article on the CBC website about 15 months ago, that was talking about Get Coding and how the company works.  It seemed like a perfect fit for me, to finally be able to change to a career I wanted.  The program may have been a perfect fit, but the internet service at my work location was not, so I had to wait.  But I have changed jobs since then, and I am now able to devote my off time while working, to the program.</p>
		<p>I cannot afford to take large chunks of time off work, someone still has to pay the bills!  But with Get Coding, I would be able to continue working, and also get immense training and guidance for a career in the tech industry.  And to make things better, Get Coding is based here in NL.</p>
		<p>No other program can do that and still be able to help support Newfoundlanders.  It would be an honour to join Get Coding and become a success through your program.</p>
